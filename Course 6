Course 6: Detection and Response

Using data to see what a threat actor did on my networl

Incident response lifecycle
Monitor and analyze newtork traffic
Processes and procedurs
Interpret logs and alert


NIST CSF
identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover

All security incidents are an event but not all events are a security incident
Event: observable occurance on a network, system, or device
  Requesting a password reset is logged that something happen
  > A security incident would be if it was done by a threat actor

Who triggered the incident
What Happened
When the incident took place
Where the incident took place
Why the incident occured
> Incident handler's journal

CSIRT / Incident handling team
security Analyst: investigate security alerts to determine if an incdient has occured
Technical Lead: Escalated if the incident is high
Incident coordinator: Cross collaborator ensured everyone is update like public relations
> incident managment and response


Tier 1 SOC analyst
The first tier is composed of the least experienced SOC analysts who are known as level 1s (L1s). They are responsible for:
Monitoring, reviewing, and prioritizing alerts based on criticality or severity
Creating and closing alerts using ticketing systems
Escalating alert tickets to Tier 2 or Tier 3

Tier 2 SOC analyst
The second tier comprises the more experienced SOC analysts, or level 2s (L2s). They are responsible for: 
Receiving escalated tickets from L1 and conducting deeper investigations
Configuring and refining security tools
Reporting to the SOC Lead

Tier 3 SOC lead
The third tier of a SOC is composed of the SOC leads, or level 3s (L3s). These highly experienced professionals are responsible for:
Managing the operations of their team
Exploring methods of detection by performing advanced detection techniques, such as malware and forensics analysis
Reporting to the SOC manager

SOC manager 
The SOC manager is at the top of the pyramid and is responsible for: 
Hiring, training, and evaluating the SOC team members
Creating performance metrics and managing the performance of the SOC team
Developing reports related to incidents, compliance, and auditing
Communicating findings to stakeholders such as executive management   

Other roles
SOCs can also contain other specialized roles such as: 
Forensic investigators: Forensic investigators are commonly L2s and L3s who collect, preserve, and analyze digital evidence related to security incidents to determine what happened.
Threat hunters: Threat hunters are typically L3s who work to detect, analyze, and defend against new and advanced cybersecurity threats using threat intelligence.

-
Incident response plans

incident response procedures
System Information: network diagram and data flow diagram
Other docs: Contact list, forms, etc
> regularly reviewed and inspected and exercise

-
Incident response tools
Tools that Monitor events
Documentation tools to collect and compile evidence

-
Incident's handlers jounral documents the 5W's of an incident

types of documentation: playbooks, incdent handler jounals, policies, plans
no indsutry standard for documentation, tailored to needs and legal requirements

effective documentation reduces confusion. not easily misunderstood
Ticket systems can be used to document too (ex: Jira)
-
IDS / IPS
IDS monitors systems and network activity for abnormal activities
IPS same capabilities of IDS but can take action
  Snort, zeek, kismet, sagan, suricata

Detection categories
As a security analyst, you will investigate alerts that an IDS generates. There are four types of detection categories you should be familiar with:

A true positive is an alert that correctly detects the presence of an attack.
A true negative is a state where there is no detection of malicious activity. This is when no malicious activity exists and no alert is triggered. 
A false positive is an alert that incorrectly detects the presence of a threat. This is when an IDS identifies an activity as malicious, but it isn't. False positives are an inconvenience for security teams because they spend time and resources investigating an illegitimate alert. 
A false negative is a state where the presence of a threat is not detected. This is when malicious activity happens but an IDS fails to detect it. False negatives are dangerous because security teams are left unaware of legitimate attacks that they can be vulnerable to. 


Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is an application that monitors an endpoint for malicious activity. EDR tools are installed on endpoints. 
Remember that an endpoint is any device connected on a network. Examples include end-user devices, like computers, phones, tablets, and more.

EDRs collect endpoint activity data and perform behavioral analysis to identify threat patterns happening on an endpoint. Behavioral analysis uses the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to analyze system behavior to identify malicious or unusual activity. EDR tools also use automation to stop attacks without the manual intervention of security professionals. 
For example, if an EDR detects an unusual process starting up on a userâ€™s workstation that normally is not used, it can automatically block the process from running.


log data on SIEM
1. collect and aggregate raw data from logs
2. normalize data, removes nonessential attributes, creating consistency and log levels
3. Analyzed via configured rule sets 

April 3 11:01:21 server sshd[1088]: Failed password for user nuhara from 218.124.14.105 port 5023
In a parsed format, the fields and values are extracted and paired making them easier to read and interpret:
host = server
process = sshd
source_user = nuhara
source ip = 218.124.14.105
source port = 5023


SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
Collection of applications, tools, workflows that automate analysis and response to security events.
Track response to security events and incidents
